When it comes to learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), the "best" sheet depends on your goals (interview prep, competitive programming, or foundational learning). Below are some of the **most recommended DSA sheets/courses** used by developers globally:

---

### **1. Striverâ€™s SDE Sheet (Top Choice for Interviews)**
- **Topics Covered**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Heaps, and more.
- **Why itâ€™s great**: 
  - Curated by **Raj Vikramaditya** (Striver), designed for FAANG/tech company interviews.
  - 180â€“200 problems with varying difficulty (easy to hard).
  - Focuses on **optimal solutions** and pattern recognition.
  - Free video explanations available on YouTube.

---

### **How to Use These Sheets Effectively**:
1. **Start with basics**: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists.
2. **Solve 2â€“3 problems daily** (consistency > quantity).
3. **Understand patterns**, not just solutions (e.g., sliding window, BFS/DFS).
4. Track progress using tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) or Excel.
5. Revise solved problems after a week.

---

### **Final Recommendation**:
- **Beginners**: Start with **NeetCode 150** or **Striverâ€™s SDE Sheet**.
- **Short on time**: **Blind 75**.
- **Advanced learners**: **LeetCode Hard** or competitive programming platforms like Codeforces.
